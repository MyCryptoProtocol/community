## Summary

A brief (1-2 paragraph) summary of the proposal. This should clearly explain what the MCIP is trying to accomplish in language understandable to non-technical community members.

## Abstract

A slightly more technical explanation of what this MCIP aims to accomplish. This section should explain the mechanism of the change or addition without diving into implementation details.

## Motivation

Why should this MCIP be implemented? What problem does it solve? What benefits does it bring to the MCP ecosystem? Who are the stakeholders that will be affected?

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current MCP platforms.

### Technical Details

Provide detailed technical information about the proposal. This may include:

- API changes
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Protocol modifications
- Interface requirements

### Backwards Compatibility

Discuss how this proposal affects backwards compatibility. Will existing implementations, agents, or contexts need to be updated? If so, what is the upgrade path?

### Security Considerations

Discuss the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information about the threat model and how the change addresses potential security issues.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.

## Implementation

This section should include reference implementations, test cases, and any other relevant implementation details. For technical MCIPs, this may include code snippets, pseudocode, or links to prototype implementations.

### Timeline

Outline the expected timeline for implementation, including major milestones and dependencies.

### Required Resources

What resources will be needed to implement this MCIP? This might include development time, funding, or other resources.
