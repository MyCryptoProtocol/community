# MCP Governance

This directory contains information about the governance process for MyCryptoProtocol (MCP). Governance refers to how decisions are made about the protocol's development, updates, and resource allocation.

## Governance Principles

MCP governance is guided by these core principles:

1. **Decentralization**: Decisions should be distributed among stakeholders rather than centralized
2. **Transparency**: Decision-making processes should be open and visible to all
3. **Inclusivity**: All community members should have opportunities to participate
4. **Merit**: Proposals should be evaluated based on their merit and potential impact
5. **Continuous Improvement**: The governance system itself should evolve based on feedback

## Governance Mechanisms

### MCP Improvement Proposals (MCIPs)

MCIPs are the primary mechanism for proposing changes to the MCP ecosystem. The process works as follows:

1. **Draft**: Author creates a draft proposal using the [MCIP template](./MCIP_TEMPLATE.md)
2. **Discussion**: Community discusses the proposal in the forum and Discord
3. **Revision**: Author updates the proposal based on feedback
4. **Formal Review**: Core contributors review the finalized proposal
5. **Voting**: Token holders vote on the proposal
6. **Implementation**: Approved proposals are implemented by contributors

### Token-Based Voting

The $MCP token grants voting rights to token holders. Voting power is proportional to token holdings, with mechanisms to prevent excessive centralization of power.

#### Voting on MCIPs

- Voting periods typically last 7 days
- Quorum requirements ensure sufficient participation
- Special majorities are required for protocol-critical changes

### Working Groups

Working groups focus on specific areas of the protocol:

- **Technical Working Group**: Protocol development and technical standards
- **Integration Working Group**: New service integrations and context standards
- **Community Working Group**: Community growth and engagement
- **Treasury Working Group**: Resource allocation and grants
